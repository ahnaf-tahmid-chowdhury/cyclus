Cyclus is built using ``CMake``. A full list of the Cyclus package
dependencies is shown below:

Installing Dependencies
***********************

Cyclus dependencies can either be installed manually or using an operating system's package
manager.

Installing Dependencies (Linux and Unix)
----------------------------------------

This guide assumes that the user has root access (to issue ``sudo`` commands) and
access to a package manager or has some other suitable method of automatically
installing established libraries. This process was tested using a fresh install
of Ubuntu versions 20.04 and 22.04, using ``apt-get`` as the package
manager (scroll down further for Mac OSX instructions).

The command to install a dependency takes the form of:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo apt-get install package

where "package" is replaced by the correct package name. The minimal list of
required library package names is:

#. make
#. cmake
#. pkg-config
#. libboost-all-dev (see note below)
#. libxml2-dev
#. libxml++2.6-dev
#. python3-dev
#. libsqlite3-dev
#. libhdf5-dev
#. liblapack-dev


and (optionally):

#. doxygen
#. libgoogle-perftools-dev
#. coinor-libcbc-dev
#. coinor-libcoinutils-dev
#. coinor-libosi-dev
#. coinor-libclp-dev
#. python3-tables
#. python3-pandas
#. python3-numpy
#. python3-pytest
#. python3-jinja2
#. python3-pip
#. cython3       (see note below)

For example, in order to install libxml++ (and libxml2) on your system, type:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo apt-get install libxml++2.6-dev

If you'd prefer to copy/paste, the following line will install all **required**
*Cyclus* dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo apt-get install -y cmake make pkg-config libboost-all-dev libxml2-dev libxml++2.6-dev \
   python3-dev libsqlite3-dev libhdf5-dev liblapack-dev

And to install all *Cyclus* dependencies (**required and optional**):

.. code-block:: console

   sudo apt-get install -y cmake make pkg-config libboost-all-dev libxml2-dev libxml++2.6-dev \
   python3-dev libsqlite3-dev libhdf5-dev liblapack-dev coinor-libcbc-dev coinor-libcoinutils-dev \
   coinor-libosi-dev coinor-libclp-dev coinor-libcgl-dev doxygen libgoogle-perftools-dev python3-tables \
   python3-pandas python3-numpy python3-pytest python3-jinja2 cython3

To determine which version of Python is already installed on your computer, run:

.. code-block:: console

   python -V


Despite having installed python3, Ubuntu installations may still point at python2 by default. So Python -V can return a version of python that is not preferred. In that case the python version can be changed system-wide with the update-alternatives command. 

First, you can list alternatives with the following command:

 .. code-block:: console

   update-alternatives --list python

Ubuntu may not list any alternatives. To make Ubuntu aware of python 3, use:

 .. code-block:: console

   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1

From now on, to switch between different versions, use:

 .. code-block:: console

   sudo update-alternatives --config python

Even if you only have a single python installation, you may have to use update-alternatives to point python at the correct version to avoid build errors.

Check your current python version with the following command:

 .. code-block:: console

   python --version

Then make Ubuntu aware of your current python version. Run the following command, using the python version you just checked. The following command uses version python3.8 as an example and will fail if you do not replace 3.8 with your own version number.

 .. code-block:: console

   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.8 2


Cython Note
^^^^^^^^^^^
If you get an error related to an old Cython version, then this may be 
because the Debian stable version of Cython is 0.23.4. However, 
Cyclus requires 0.29.0+. To install the latest cython version, please 
visit the `Cython Documentation`_.

Boost Note
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``libboost-all-dev`` used above will install the entire Boost library, which
is not strictly needed. We currently depend on a small subset of the Boost
libraries:

#. libboost-program-options-dev
#. libboost-system-dev
#. libboost-filesystem-dev

However, it is possible (likely) that additional Boost libraries will be used
because they are an industry standard. Accordingly, we suggest simply installing
``libboost-all-dev`` to limit any headaches due to possible dependency additions
in the future.

Installing Dependencies (Mac OSX)
---------------------------------

Cyclus archetype development is not fully supported on Mac.  Nonetheless,
because there are some use cases which require installation from source, we have
compiled a list of instructions that should be successful.  Use a Mac platform
at your own risk; we strongly recommend Linux as a primary development environment.

This guide assumes that the user has root access (to issue ``sudo`` commands) and
access to a package manager or has some other suitable method of automatically
installing established libraries. This process was tested using a fresh install
of 10.11.6 (El Capitan) using ``macports`` as the package
manager.  Macports installs packages in ``/opt/local``.  If installing to a
different location, (i.e. ``/usr/local``) change paths in the following
instructions accordingly. If you use ``homebrew``, try the following instructions
with brew commands in place of the port commands.

The command to install a dependency takes the form of:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo port install package

where "package" is replaced by the correct package name. The minimal list of
required library package names is:

#. cmake
#. boost
#. hdf5
#. libxml2
#. libxmlxx2
#. sqlite3
#. doxygen
#. glibmm

Then install Coin-Cbc from source. They can be downloaded to any directory on
your computer:

**Coin-Cbc**: Download and build using the svn command in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cbc/stable/2.8 Coin-Cbc
  cd Coin-Cbc/
  mkdir build
  cd build/
  ../configure --prefix=/opt/local
  make
  sudo make install


Finally, update your path and the following environment variables in your
``~/.profile`` (or ``~/.bashrc`` ) file:

.. code-block:: console

  export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:/opt/local:$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH

  export CMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/opt/local/include:$CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/local:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

  # add to PATH:
  export PATH=${HDF5_DIR}:/opt/local/bin:${HOME}/.local/bin:$PATH
