/// This includes the required header to add a material sell policy to
/// archetypes. One should only need to:
/// - '#include "toolkit/matl_sell_policy.cycpp.h"' in the header of the
///    archetype class (it is strongly recommended to inject this snippet as
///    `private:`, but archetype developers are free to make other choices)

/// How to add parameters to this file:
/// 1. Add the pragma. A default value MUST be added to ensure backwards
///    compatibility.
/// 2. Add "std::vector<int> cycpp_shape_<param_name> = {0};" to the end of the
///    file with the other ones, reaplcing <param_name> with the name you put
///    in the econ_params array (again, must match exactly).
