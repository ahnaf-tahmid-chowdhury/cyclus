/// MatlBuyPolicy performs semi-automatic inventory management of a material
/// buffer by making requests and accepting materials in an attempt to fill the
/// buffer fully every time step according to an (s, S) inventory policy (see
/// [1]).
///
/// For simple behavior, policies virtually eliminate the need to write any code
/// for resource exchange. Just assign a few policies to work with a few buffers
/// and focus on writing the physics and other behvavior of your agent.  Typical
/// usage goes something like this:
///
/// @code
/// class YourAgent : public cyclus::Facility {
///  public:
///   ...
///
///   void EnterNotify() {
///     cyclus::Facility::EnterNotify(); // always do this first
///
///     policy_.Init(this, &inbuf_, "inbuf-label").Set(incommod, comp).Start();
///   }
///   ...
///
///  private:
///   MatlBuyPolicy policy_;
///   ResBuf<Material> inbuf_;
///    ...
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// The policy needs to be initialized with its owning agent and the material
/// buffer that is is managing. It also needs to be activated by calling the
/// Start function for it to begin participation in resource exchange.  And
/// don't forget to add some commodities to request by calling Set.  All policy
/// configuration should usually occur in the agent's EnterNotify member
/// function.

  /// @param manager the agent
  /// @param buf the resource buffer
  /// @param name a unique name identifying this policy
  /// @param throughput a constraining value for total transaction quantities in
  /// a single time step
  /// @param inv_policy the inventory policy to use. Options are "sS", "RQ".
  /// Each inventory policy options has two additional required parameters. An
  /// (s,S) inventory policy orders material only when the buffer is below the
  /// minimum value, s, and orders only enough to bring the buffer to the
  /// maximum value, S. An (s,S) policy allows partial orders. Set s as req_at
  /// and S as fill. An (R,Q) inventory policy requests material when the
  /// buffer is below the minimum value, R, and places an exclusive request for
  /// size Q. Set R as req_at and Q as fill.
  /// @param req_at, the inventory minimum (s, and R) for (s,S) and (R,Q),. If
  /// the buffer has less than or equal to value, new material will be
  /// requested based on the policy in place.
  /// @param fill_behav, the quantity govering the fill strategy for inventory
  /// policies. For (s,S), this is the maximum value, and material will be
  /// ordered up to this amount. For (R,Q), this is the quantity of material
  /// that will be ordered (exclusive).
  /// @param cumulative_cap the cumulative capacity of material to be received
  /// in one active cycle. A cumulative cap inventory policy allows for a
  /// cumulative capacity of material to be received in one active cycle. Once
  /// the cumulative capacity is recieved, the agent enters a dormant period.
  /// Also requires dormant distributions using dormant_dist.
  /// @param quantize If quantize is greater than zero, the policy will make
  /// exclusive, integral quantize kg requests.  Otherwise, single requests will
  /// be sent to fill the buffer's empty space.
  /// @warning, (s, S) policy values are ambiguous for buffers with a capacity
  /// in (0, 1]. However that is a rare case.
  /// The following features, if used, will set the policy to so that agents
  /// cycle through "on" phases, where the buf will attemp to be filled, and
  /// "off" or dormant phases, where no requests will be made regardless of
  /// capacity.  The "on" and "off" phases are sampled and rounded to the
  /// nearest integer number of time steps from a truncated normal
  /// distribution from a mean, standard deviation, min, and max value.
  /// Note that the (s, S) policy is not currently compatible with active and
  /// Active and dormant buying perionds
  /// Active parameters:
  /// @param active_dist an IntDistribution object that will be used to sample
  /// the number of time steps in the "on" phase.  If not set, a fixed
  /// distribution with a value of 1 will be used.
  /// @param dormant_dist an IntDistribution object that will be used to sample
  /// the number of time steps in the "off" phase.  If not set, a fixed
  /// distribution with a value of 0 will be used (no dormant, always on)
  /// @param size_dist a DoubleDistribution object that will be used to sample
  /// the size of the request as a fraction of the available capacity at the
  /// current time step.  If not set, a fixed distribution with a value of
  /// 1.0 will be used.
  /// Note that active and dormant periods are note currently compatible with
  /// (s, S) inventory management
